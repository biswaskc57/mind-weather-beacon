# 🛰️ Calmos: Predictive Mental Health Insights from Earth & Space

**Live Project**: [View on Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/6cfd4e41-9b2d-459a-8dea-e82f3509be2a)

## 💡 Overview

**Calmos** is an innovative web application that leverages **Copernicus** and **Galileo satellite data** alongside biometric data from wearables to **predict stress levels** and understand the impact of environmental factors on mental health. 

By correlating atmospheric variables like **PM2.5, ozone, UV, pollen, noise**, and **humidity** with **heart rate, sleep patterns, and blood oxygen levels**, users receive **personalized mental well-being insights** that promote proactive and preventive care.

This project was developed for the **"Mental Health and Well-Being"** track of a space-health hackathon challenge.

## 🔭 Roadmap

- [ ] Real-time wearable integration (Empatica, Fitbit)
- [ ] ML-based stress prediction model with feedback loop
- [ ] Daily local health alerts based on satellite & user data
- [ ] Chatbot to recommend lifestyle changes based on correlations

## 🧠 Why This Matters

**Mental health** is deeply affected by both **internal** (biometrics) and **external** (environmental) factors. While wearable tech captures personal health signals, **space data** gives us a powerful lens into invisible triggers — from pollution to radiation. **MindScape bridges that gap** for the first time.
